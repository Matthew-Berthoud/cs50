# cs50: Harvard's Intro to Computer Science

I did this free online course bit by bit during school year breaks in order to learn more about computer science, and have more projects to do. The course starts with lots of programming in C, then touches Python, and then moves onto more full stack stuff. Notably, I learned SQL, HTML/CSS, and Flask which helped me make my personal website, and I'll continue to use Flask in future side projects.

For the final project in this course I made an iOS app imitation of the classic 80s handheld electronic game "Mattel Electronic Football" with SwiftUI in XCode. See another repo from this account, or my website for that project.
