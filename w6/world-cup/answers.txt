Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Canada was expected to have a higher chance than Japan in later runs.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Probably not until the end. There's still a lot of variability in the later trials.
